# GuessTheNumberProject

## Development:
This project’s development began at the start of my studies in October 2022, and whilst it isn’t an advanced program in terms of functionality, it allowed me to get to grips with Java as a language on a basic level. A later version integrated object-orientated programming concepts as I was getting familiar with them, playing a key role in the development process of future personal and coursework projects.

## Purpose:
I developed this project as a simple ‘guess the number’ game that allowed me to explore basic control flow logic and the key features of Java, while the later version allowed me to understand object-orientated programming concepts such as encapsulation and abstraction.
